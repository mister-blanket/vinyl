Izumo,237,x,"At the airport McDonald's, I accidentally order only one hash brown and get very angry. I realize how dumb I am being and stop. We fly on a plane and ride on two buses. Then we are at Izumo-Taisha, which is the oldest Shinto shrine in Japan. Liz informs me that the Japanese word for October translates roughly to 'without gods'. It is called that because in October all of the Shinto gods in Japan leave their shrines and come to Izumo-Taisha to hang out. Liz finds a beautiful little frog. Then she finds a praying mantis on the main shrine gate. Then she finds a beautiful beetle on a sign post. Were these creatures the gods in earthly forms? Yes. Now we walk in the sun and arrive at Tanakaya, a quaint restaurant which serves homemade soba in the Izumo style. They process the buckwheat with the hull included, this making the noodles darker, coarser, and earthier. The noodles are served on three trays, each with a different topping (foam, daikon, egg). Our server brings us a pot of pasta water, serves us a cup, and pours a splash of dashi in it. We get on a bus and ride through the windy mountains to the edge of the peninsula. There is another nice old shrine there so we get out and explore it. Older people here talk to us as though we speak the language. It is quite charming. We start walking towards the ocean, but Liz sees a cat, then two more, then two more. She approaches slowly. They are sunning and cleaning; they don't run off. We spend the next half hour sitting in the street playing with some sweet babes. The cheeky boy is especially fond of Liz. He climbs into her lap, she cradles him, and they fall in love. We walk up the mountain. Small shops are selling beautiful sea shells and blowfish with googly-eyes attached. I very nearly step on a praying mantis. We get to the lighthouse. It is white brick against a white sky. We walk along a cliff and lean out over rough, foamy, emerald  ocean. We bus back to town. Liz has a headache and sleeps. I work on my resume. Two hours later we get up and head to Taste, a Brooklyn inspired restaurant. The tiny room is full, but the owner comes out and constructs a table out of saw horses for us in the parking lot. Craft beer, potato salad, fried olives, mushroom and duck salad, tuna tartar. Liz drops a piece of tuna on the ground. I consciously turn around for a few seconds. It is gone. I'm still hungry so we get chicken wings. Liz is messaging with Kyle, who informs her that he and his friend were just nearly victims of a hate crime stabbing. He is fine, but we are shaken. Walking home, we stop into a conbini and get ice cream. Liz's is rich milk. Mine is sweet potato and comes in a cardboard-like cone, which quite closely resembles the look and feel of a sweet potato.<br><br>We sleep until 9:50. Checkout is at 10:00. I shave in the lobby bathroom. We walk down the canal. An old man looks at us, tells us something, and flaps his arms behind his back. He points behind a low bridge. Below the bridge is a large, white crane. It is feeding on small fish and is majestic in the shade. Into a cafe next door. The wood is dark from years of wear, the furniture is post-war. There are huge potted plants in concrete. Liz says it smells like her grandparents' house when Hans was alive. We eat gratin, fish, and chicken. I nearly fall asleep at the table. We had intended to go to a nearby onsen town, but the bus ride costly, so we opt to go bowling instead. The building looks nearly abandoned. There are only squat toilets. The lanes are very oily and on my first throw I slip and bang my knee on the wood. I focus on my form and center of gravity. Liz and I tie the first game at 109. We both beat our scores in the second game with Liz at 120 and me at 137, which is likely my personal best. I rent ping pong paddles and look for Liz. I find her at a slot machine in the kids arcade. She wins two of three games. I eat a not-good melon pan at the airport and I fly home. Liz doesn't make the first flight, so she watches The Handmaid's Tale for three hours at the airport.",l,Birthplace,"35.433922, 132.628204","Oct 5, 2019","Oct 6, 2019",,Izumo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kyoto,236,x,"We have sushi from a plastic tray in the airport. We land outside of Osaka and take the monorail to the Expo '70 Park. We have tickets to see the newly reopened interior of the Tower of the Sun. The inside features a zig-zagging staircase, which works its way up around the Tree of Life, which is more like and upturned root upon which are mounted animatronic (not operating, unfortunately) plaster creatures. From low to high they are meant to represent the progress of evolution of life on Earth. The gorilla's head is missing, leaving behind only hydraulic pumps and metal jaws. We take two trains and a bus to Ryoanji temple. It is very cool, green, and mossy. We take off our shoes and walk on soft, old wood. There is a rock feature where six large rocks are surrounded by a pond of beautifully raked pebbles. We wander the complex and find a seven-legged spider constructing a scribbly web. We get a sparkling apple and jelly drink and get on a very crowded bus heading for the center of town. We go by Kichi Kichi Omurice, not expecting to get in, but are let in. We order the classic Omurice and a beef stew. The man with purple hair puts on a fun show of making the rice. It is all yummy and we eat it very quickly. We take a bus to a food hall, where we find The Roots of All Evil - Little Evil: celery gin, black Sambuca, plum wine. Ghost Note: gin, absinthe, bonito, matcha, grapefruit, honey. Liz sees the bartender drink from the mixing spoon multiple times. We have a mediocre donut and bus back north. We head to nokishika711 gin and cocktail labo for: Fungus Negroni: Shitake gin, amaro, sake, shoyu, umami bitters, fermented mushroom; The Roots: gin (burdock, cardamom, coriander, cinnamon), fermented burdock bitters, ginger ale, rosemary, ginger shoot, cucumber. The drinks are great. We walk back through the touristy area. A young guy is covering Tears in Heaven. Not far a way is a man in an fold-open van wearing a duck hat, singing with a duck toy in his mouth, and entertaining a good crowd. His van says He is Starduck Tony.<br><br>We check our of hotel #1. We walk to Koe donuts for a wasanbon and a pistachio cake donut. We continue to a nice little shop for cold brew. Northward to Aoonigiri for salmon & salmon roe, curry chicken, miso & negi, and tofu & bonito onigiri sets. The owner has a monk-like quality and the restaurant feels sacred and hushed. Next we get on a cute train, with outward facing seats, up to the mountains. We arrive at Kurama, a Tengu-inspired mountain shrine hike. We hike up in gorgeous cool weather. We hike down in the rain. We learn that Liz's rain jacket isn't actually all that water resistant. We get back to the hotel and change into what warm clothes we have. After a while we get up and walk to Cocina Órale for margaritas, chips & salsa, nachos and delicious tacos. We walk just a couple of minutes and return to nokishika711 for Soil & Pimp Sessions: burdock gin, black soybean bitters, whisky, tonic, herbs, soil. Silly Symphony: porcini gin, chestnut, yogurt, soda, fermented mushroom, honey, egg white, chocolate. Fly Me to the Moon: spice gin, Suze, sake, ginseng bitters, moon candy, pumpkin flake.",l,Final Round,"35.116725, 135.766938","Sep 21, 2019","Sep 22, 2019",,Kyoto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Da Nang,235,x,"At 9:30 we get a call from the from desk to remind us that breakfast is closing soon. We eat. It is surprisingly good. I meditate for the first time in a few days. I fantasize about sex as a distraction from the discomfort of stillness. Our driver from last night takes us to My Son. Back-lit cattails beard rust brick rubble piles. This is a nursing home for retired buildings. Moss liver spots. The beings lean to one side. Many require support to sit upright. Some show obvious cosmetic work. All are thinning on top. Tufts of shrubbery grow from strange new nooks. They are very old. They exist now only to remind us of how life used to be. I am briefly tempted to kick one. It is cloudy, we are sweaty. There are loud, unfamiliar insects. I can hear gongs and drums in the distance. When I get to where I think the sound originated, there is nothing there. We hydrate and leave. We are dropped right into Hoi An Old Town. The sun is setting and there are hundreds of cloth lanterns out. We hit the food stalls. Banana pancake with Nutella. Vietnamese pizza, unsure what it was exactly. Sticky rice banana. We sit at a street-side cafe and have beers. A young girl tries to sell us lanterns, two times. She is very adorable and Liz decides to give her a couple of dollars. She hugs Liz and kisses her on the cheek. Liz looks ready to cry. We are very sticky and decide to have a Banh Mi  and call it a night.<br><br>At breakfast a kind woman makes me a very strong coffee and gives another man the waffle I made. We take the shuttle to Old Town. The sky is old dishwasher and it's being wrung out over the whole of the region today. We find a Banh My stand with a long line and get it. They put at three different sauce spreads and four different types of meat on this. The bread is very french and newborn. It is the best thing we've eaten in Vietnam. There are so many flavors at once and interesting changes from bite to bite. I can't comprehend it, but I love it. We walk through miniature lakes and rivers. We wade upstream and find a spa. We get decent foot massages. My hairy legs need about 300% more oil than Liz's. I meditate in the car on the way to Da Nang. Get to the hotel and relaxed. We look for the hot tub, but there isn't one. It's still quite rainy out and we are feeling a recuperative type of night so we touch good and get Indian. The lamb korma is the best I've ever tasted and the chicken Tikka Masala is unique and delicious.<br><br>We finish the delicious curry cold then top it off with a mediocre hotel buffet. Hai picks us up and drives us to Ba Na Hills, a Vietnam Disneyland. He plays techno at a soft volume. We ride a very long cable car and arrive. We spend the next few hours exploring Medieval Square, Buddhism World, Big Hands Bridge, and Jules Verne Arcade. I am slightly disappointed at the absence of a Communism Cafe or Viet-Cong Village. We ride a two-person roller coaster. We eat Vietnamese doughnut balls, a sausage on a stick, and a strawberry smoothie. We wander a lot and head to the arcade. We play a Crusin' USA type game and basketball game, which Liz does exceptionally well at. Back to the hotel for a nap. We wake and get a ride to Hải Sản Đà Nẵng Nhà hàng Bé Mặn, a point-to-your-dinner seafood hall, which appears to be quite popular with the locals. We get eight chili garlic shrimp, two big blue langoustines, ten green sauce oysters, Morning Glory, fried rice, and some beers. Afterward, we walk down the beach. There are many little crabs running around. I manage to chase one who runs sideways with his pincers up. We come back and watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.<br><br>Breakfast and face masks, so-so massages, more superlative Indian, and then we head to the airport. We fly there to HCMC, but on the flight Liz starts feeling unwell. We land and she goes to the bathroom for a while. She has diarrhea, is vomiting and is having intense stomach pains, which increase in severity. She lies on a bench in the Departure terminal. We decide not to to fly to Tokyo tonight. We decide to get a cab and a hotel, but she can't even stand up to walk to the car pickup. Eventually she is able to walk and we decide to go to the hospital. We get a ride and go in the local hospital first. It is pretty depressing and no one speaks English. I try filling out a form in Vietnamese. A man wearing only pants runs out yelling in pain. I see hospital beds with blood stains on them. One of the staff manages to tell me that the international clinic is actually the next building over. We go there and it is a much nicer experience immediately. A doctor very quickly diagnoses Liz as having food poisoning and prescribes her some pain and nausea medication. She comes out to the lobby where I am waiting with our bags, but he quickly calls her back again. I wait for about 40 minutes. I hear the occasional yelp of pain. She is the only person in there and I begin to worry. I eventually inquire as to what is happening. Apparently they gave Liz a cot to lie on. I find her sleeping there, but still in a lot of pain. Soon she gets up and we get a ride to a cheap airport hotel.<br><br>I walk to get water, Pocari Sweat, and McDonald's. She seems to be feeling considerably better and eats all of her food. She sleeps more and I meditate and look for jobs. We watch The King of Comedy and Shock Treatment, which make for a pretty fun double feature. On the plane I watch Inside Out and cry deeply.",r,Southern Vietnam,"16.056932, 108.246375","Aug 28, 2019","Sep 2, 2019",,"Ho Chi Min City, Mekong, Hoi An, Da Nang",,"15.878503, 108.331998","16.056932, 108.246375","15.996980, 107.989971",,,,,,,,,,,
Ho Chi Min City,234,x,"Getting here seemed unnecessarily stressful. I felt slighted when the bus driver charged me double fare to account for my suitcase. Realizing that the cost of two fares combined totaled about $.50 helped, a little. Traffic is chaotic. Motorcycles appear as cells in a large amoeba. Lots of coughing and hacking. The bus is clean. The driver takes off his shoes before getting into his chair. An old man is meditating in the median of a busy street. Couples are playing badminton in the park. The air is hazy like Santorini. People wear loose-fitting face masks and helmets. I stop on a bridge and record the sound of mostly motorcycles. I get in, meet Cori, and catch up. We are both quite tired so we sleep. Hours later we are up. I grab a bitter, unsweetened coffee and spicy nori from 7/11. We chat a bit, talk with Sean, and go for a walk. It is pouring, but completely dies off in less than two minutes. Our first stop is Tung I'm Hungry for Pho Kho Ga. The noodles are dry. The woman who served them pours many condiments on top and mixes them all together. It is sweet, spicy, peanuty, and herbaceous. There is also a meat-stock soup. We talk about The Spell of the Sensuous, a few other books, and single-celled organisms. We walk again for a while. We arrive at Workshop, a Third Wave shop, and have a local espresso latte. It's complex and reminds me of going down on a woman. V60, passion fruit cheesecake, and pumpkin roll round it off. Young cats hang out on a motorcycle. We slowly wander back. I mediate and Cori stretches. Liz arrives. We all catch up and eat English chocolate. We get a ride to Hum, which is a vegetarian restaurant owned by the same people who run Uu Dam Chay in Hanoi. We eat loads of delicious veggies, pecan fried rice, panang tofu pucks, young banana, and doughnut balls. We wander the streets looking for either a massage or a bar. We eventually settle on Below Whisky Den. There is a group of 8 people clapping loudly and in poor sync with TLC's Waterfalls. We order and drink some very good stuff. Mine is whiskey forward and delicious. Liz's tastes like Cold Stone Cake Batter™ ice cream. A guy from the Bronx plays a set of covers ranging from Johnny Cash for Jeff Buckley. He sounds good and blesses us. We are very tired.<br><br>Liz has a headache. Cori is working. I read some Douglas Adams and eat nori. I go for a walk, wander through a local market. The colors, lighting, angles, smells, and sounds overwhelm me. Raw meat is being chopped on a counter. A woman is gutting a fish. Shrimp in a bowl of water. A big rat scurrying in the dim light. Stacks of packages I can not understand. I buy coconut, which a master drains and de-meats into a bag in seconds. It starts to rain. It starts to pour. I stand in the shop and listen to it. Back. Liz is up and feeling slightly better. We eat coconut. The three of us head back out to the market. I see a woman cooking something that looks like a bright green pancake. We get one, it is coconut and pandan and delicious. We also get a fried plantain and some other fried ball. We walk through the market and see many beautiful vegetables and fruits. Shrimp are jumping out of baskets. Eggs coated in charcoal. Chicken feet. A pigs head. A cage packed full of chickens. Frogs tied together with plastic. We head to a stall and get a noodle soup with tomato, fish cake, snails, and a blood brick. The broth is pleasant. It was Bun Rieu. We find another fried plantain stand and have that. There is some fun workout equipment and we play on that for a bit. We walk to Workshop for more coffee and passion fruit cheesecake. Now to get feet massages, which is nice nice. We go by two different kitchenware stores and find some salt dishes and chopsticks. Liz found a place that looks promising called Racha, so we head there for dinner. We order some great cocktails. For food we get: charcoal tempura calamari, beef mint salad, fried silken tofu, duck shiitake dumplings, wagyu gyoza, crab lemongrass wontons, spare ribs, and beef tongue with rice crackers. It is all very yummy. Back at home we play Name That Crease™ with Sean.<br><br>I wake up. It's 10:30. Liz had a headache in the night, but is feeling better now. I make a coffee and we snack on nori. Cori comes back from a workout and I improvise a song and dance for her return. We take our time and eventually head out. We get a delicious banana coconut drink. The massage place is full, but we make an appointment. Walk to My Banh Mi for chicken lemongrass with spicy garlic, and coconut pork with black pepper cream, plus a side of spring roll. A man, who we later presume is the owner, tells us about the origin of mole, Caesar salad and chimichangas. We look briefly and the Notre Dame and get a ride to the War Remnants Museum, which focuses on the destruction of the US in the war. We certainly caused a lot of it. We rush over to get very good massages from two very strong ladies. Back to the apartment where we swim with Cori, talk about gender, and head to Bed Nha Luv Tinh, a restaurant that Cori had recommended. Tofu with seafood, catfish in clay pot, beef with salt, duck skewer with sugar sticky rice, banana cake with coconut cream. We stay up late and talk about books, gender, and melatonin.<br><br>Goodbye to Cori and onto a bus for a tour. We ride with Nam, our guide, and ten other Europeans. There are many other tour groups, each is separated by culture. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Western. We get to the Cu-Chi tunnel area. We learn about tunnel building, strategy, and booby traps. People try getting into a small hole. We are taken to a shooting range where you can try firing an M-16 into a dirt hill. Many do. The climax of the tour is getting the chance to crawl through 100 meters of genuine Viet-Cong tunnel. I do. Lots of driving and then we are in Mekong. We have a big, many coursed lunch, which is better than I expected it to be. Now to a boat. The river is brown. This is right where the tiger scene happened in Apocalypse Now. It is very cloudy but there is no rain. We are turned away from a fishing village. We continue on the river and head towards a coconut candy factory where we taste and buy that. We ride a tuk-tuk through narrow concrete streets until we arrive at a performance area where a local group sings traditional Vietnamese songs and If You're Happy. I dip a piece of fruit into sugar and take a bite. It isn't sugar, it is salt. Liz was watching me and is cracking up now. Nam brings out a python and we hold it. On a small boat down where an old woman paddles us down a narrow Creek for a few minutes. Once we're out they fire up the engines and zip away. I chat with a Dutch father on the long ride back to town. At the airport. I gorge in the lounge. We arrive to Da Nang and a nice driver takes us to our hotel in Hoi An.",r,Southern Vietnam,"10.776029, 106.705160","Aug 24, 2019","Aug 27, 2019",,"Ho Chi Min City, Mekong, Hoi An, Da Nang",,"10.776029, 106.705160","10.969431, 106.497128","10.344805, 106.364799",,,,,,,,,,,
Sydney,233,x,"Woke up to a beautiful view of Hyde Park and St. Mary's Cathedral. To the posh art deco lounge for a nice breakfast where I had an mishap with a tight french press plunger and sprayed hot pulpy coffee over the table and Liz. She was very chill about it. Sydney was chilly and I didn't bring any warm stuff, so we had a shopping trip to Uniqlo. Took a bus south to White Rabbit to see Hot Blood, a collection of interesting and disturbing art from China and Taiwan. Had some overpriced blue milk from Two Sis. No luck with massages. Relaxed in the hotel for a bit. Meditated. Headed up to the bar and had some Aperol spritzes and snacks. Walked to Since I Left You where we had Little Grace: Zubrowka vodka, apple, elderflower, spice, whites; Guilty Pleasure: cognac, Pimm's, cacao, bitters, spice; Chile con frijoles toasty. Next onto PS40 and had a Day of the Dead: Chartreuse, maraschino, mezcal, egg, mole; Into the Wild: macadamia washed vodka, verjus, salt baked pineapple, basil. Walked for three minutes to Uncle Ming's. We weren't feeling the vibe in there so we left before ordering. Headed to Frankie's Pizza, which had a much better vibe. Munched on some good good pizza, drank some good beer, and listened to a local band play.<br><br>Met Sok outside a station where she then drove us into the Blue Mountains for a day of exploration. Checked out the Three Sisters and hiked around there just a bit. Headed into Katoomba and tried to go to a seemingly Hobbit-themed restaurant, but we didn't feel like waiting for an hour to get in so we had a fippy chippy (fish & chips). Headed next to Wentworth Falls for some more mini hiking, bird spotting, and fall viewing. Stopped by a cute street town to wander for a few and then headed back to Sydney. Sok dropped us off and we headed to Earls Juke Joint in New Town for some delicious local sour ales. Walked a few doors down to Lentils as Anything for a pay as you can vegan Dahl and a coconut soup. Walked a little further on to Jacoby's Tiki Bar, which was charming and had delicious drinks.<br><br>Hung at the hotel for a while and finally got the wifi working on my laptop! Headed to Cross Cafe for white bean & kale soup, caramelized cauliflower and kimchi toastie, miso pumpkin, and some PS40 sodas. It was very good. Liz went back to the hotel to work and I picked up some new ear studs from a nice piercing shop. Watched some old men play giant chess in the park then came back and meditated. Had drinks and snacks with Liz in the hotel lounge. Then we cuddled for a little bit before I had to catch my flight. Got a free katsu chicken sandwich meal with my priority pass and slept for most of the flight.",l,Once in a Lifetime,"-33.713105, 150.310943","Aug 2, 2019","Aug 5, 2019",Sok,"Fiji, Sydney",2,"-17.934460, 177.260068","-33.713105, 150.310943",,,,,,,,,,,,
Fiji,232,x,"Had some T's Tantan vegan ramen at Narita. Flew to Fiji and together watched Fight Club, which we found remarkably relevant. Had some nice chicken with oyster sauce at the Nadi Airport--they missed a golden opportunity by not naming it Nadi by Nature--then got a taxi to the resort. Met some nice humans along the way. Sat around the lobby area for a what felt like too long while they got the room ready. We played chess on a board with no pawns. We tried to play pool, but there were too few balls and the nets had big holes. Got into the room and lied down a bit. Woke up at around 5pm. Went to the pool, but there were no towels. Walked around a bit. Sat in the lounge for some decent cocktails. Found a hot tub and did that for a bit. Came back to the room. Ordered a cheese pizza and drank a bottle of bubbles. Had some nice times.<br><br>Buffet breakfast. The steamed buns in cardamom coconut milk were yummy and texturally very non-Western. Played chess on a board where each square was as long as my foot and the queen's crown came up to the ticklish part of my thigh. I beat Liz, but gave her some helpful tips. Headed to the pool where we swam as far as the swim-up bar. Dried off in the sun, read about the formation of stars, had more bubbles, ordered a pepperoni pizza, and then chatted with Mom and Jim. Got a whirlwind explanation of their cruise in the North Sea, their road trip around the Midwest, and Danny's memorial service in Middletown, CA. Just missed the sunset. To the infinity pool and more hot tub. Got smart looking. Had a local bitter beer. Arrived at the Fish restaurant apparently too close to closing because we got glares from the kitchen staff. We received some quite good--hopefully clean--food including coconut civiche, tuna poke, seared salmon filet, and cauliflower soup. Played another game of big chess in the moonlight. I won, but not as easily as before.<br><br>Buffet again for mostly coconut stuff and fries. Someone forgot to put custard in the custard donut. Received a wildly inflated hotel bill and had to sort that out. Relaxed and read a bit. Kay #2 then took us to the airport to pick up our rental car—deep inhale—which they didn't have. They didn't have any cars. The sweet woman tried to sort it out and managed to find an eight passenger van for us, but by then Liz and I had already decided we were done with Fiji and that we'd rather spend the rest of our time somewhere else in the world. We booked some tickets to Sydney and, after dealing with some very mediocre customer service, demonstrated exemplary hedonism in the well-stocked lounge—probably our favorite part of Fiji. Then we got on a flight. I exhibited inhuman restraint by not taking the penne Bolognese with shaved Parmesan or the Hagen Das single serve ice cream cup.

Naoshima,231,x,"On the train to the airport we saw a middle-aged Japanese woman wearing a backpack with pot leaves all over it. She definitely didn't know they were pot leaves. Had some vegan sushi and also a beef rice block at the airport. Caught a bus and then a ferry to get us to Naoshima. Checked out the big red pumpkin then had some long, chewy udon. Checked into our hotel and fell asleep for a few hours. Had a nice latte and missed a bus. Took a taxi to the Honmura port and got tickets for Art House, a collection of empty homes in the area which have been made into art exhibits. #1 Ishibashi for waterfalls and burnt cliffs. #2 Haisha for statue of liberty and laquer room. Stopped by 'The Water' to dip our feet in a nice pool. #3 Gokaisho for flower petals on tatami. #4 Kadoya for LED numbers in water. Walked up to Go'o shrine for white rocks, an underground chamber, and ice stairs coming up from the underground pool, through the ground, and up the shrine. To the bubble bike parking lot and then on a bus to Benesse House Museum for some more nice art and looking at the sky. Our favorite piece there was a wall of phrases like 'play and die' and 'fuck and live' written in neon. Called a cab and got our same drive from earlier (apparently there are only two taxis on the island) and headed to Naoshima I <3 Yu public bath, but got distracted by a cute mid-century Americana diner with a great smelling grill out front and had some Cajun chicken and a tuna melt there. Had a nice bath in I <3 Yu with an elephant sculpture. Saw Buddy from the diner and chatted with him for a while. It turns out he's good friends with Elovis Sato. Walked to Bar Saru for a local rice beer and a local ginger beer, which were weird and pretty good. To our tatami room for cuddles and bed.<br><br>Had some nice coffees from Mikazukishoten. Our barista was very friendly and gave us some stickers. Took a bus to Honmura and got tickets for James Turrell's Minamidera, which is a very dark room where you sit still for 15 minutes and perceive your eyes adjusting to the soft 'light screen'. It was incredible. Popped into a glass ball mini gallery. Bus down to the Chichu Museum. Waited for a while and had an olive soda, which tasted like Sour Punch rope. Into Chichu: The James Turrell pieces were profound. We did Open Field twice. Monet's lillies were poetic and De Maria's ball was heavy. Walked down to Lee Ufan for some serious minimalism and then caught a bus to Miyanora. Took the ferry and then a train to central Okayama. Went to The Coffee Bar for coffee, nice ginger ale, and a partially frozen creme brulee. Relaxed in the hotel a bit before heading out. Walked to the river and looked at the beautiful black castle. Got real sweaty. We wanted to try the local style of udon and walked for a while to a place only to find it was closed for the night. Found another that looked good and went there. I had one with spicy miso and Liz had a cold one with beef, quail egg, gobo, and fried fish stick. It was all delicious. The udon was firm, chewy, and long. Got real sleepy and went to bed.

Taipei,230,,"Landed at the close airport and took a bus to our hotel. Rested a bit and had a nice time. Walked to a very good boba stand for an oolong with taro, milk, and boba. Took a bus up north to Shilin Market. It was quite bustling. We rediscovered the basil and egg pancakes we love last time and had one. After a bit we smelled a stinky tofu stand and saw a long line. Needless to say we got in it. The tofu was fried in cubes, with a crispy outside and a spongy center, which perfectly sopped up the funky cabbage, sweet sauce, and spicy paste also in the bag. It was incredible. Wandered a bit more and then headed back to the hotel. Napped a bit more and headed to Draft Land for drinks. All of the cocktails were on tap and we had a South Island Fizz: Kaffir gin, falernum, lime, mangosteen mats soda; English Milk Punch: brandy, dark rum, cinnamon, apple, sugar, lime. Next round was Special: chili, rum, vinegar, whey and Hop Heads: IPA, oolong vodka, sherry, and a round of truffle fries. All were delicious and cheap. Walked to Bar Mood for purple potatoes, pork spare ribs, Sweet Osmanthus Blossom: Bulleit Rye, Osmanthus syrup, Carpano Dry, lemon, egg white, smoked plum and Tyrant's Blessing: mezcal, tea syrup, basil & lemongrass syrup, lemon, grapefruit, basil. Walked back.<br><br>Chatted with Liz's family for a bit. Headed to Starbucks for caffeine. Took a bus to Yongkang and ate at our favorite soup dumpling restaurant. Had a bunch of soup dumplings plus cooked green onions, a pork roll, onion black pepper buns, and black sesame buns. Everything was incredible. Up to the contemporary art museum for some contemporary art. Back to the hotel for a shower and then across the street for massages. Mine was painful and awesome. Walked to Indulge for chicken consomme, chicken liver pate, romanesco stir fry, and pork. They accidentally brought us the wrong pork (which was not very good), and they were out of the one we wanted so we had chicken wings instead (which were also not very good). For drinks we had Imperial Honeydew Cocktail: imperial honeydew tea liquor, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, cherry, spice and Lingering Autumn: rum, Osmanthus, autumn plants, shiso. Second round was Dream Big: bourbon, sour mash, Mandarin Napoleon, amaranto, black walnut, bay leaf. Grain in Ear: tequila, mango, agave, lime, orange blossom, charcoal roasted oolong beer foam. We went back to the hotel to 'lie down for just a few' before heading out to the next bar...there was no next bar.<br><br>Did some Father's Day chatting with dads and got more massages. Liz had her feet massaged. I had cupping, which was weird, painful, and oddly relieving. Headed to Toasteria for halumi with pesto, hummus, and a grilled cheese with lemon caper aioli. It was very good. Headed to Huashan 1914 Creative Park. Got a black sugar boba latte and wandered around for a bit before heading to the airport.",r,Come Again?,"25.044254, 121.529428","Jun 15, 2019","Jun 17, 2019",,Taipei,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kyoto,229,x,"Made the first flight of the day, which was awesome and unexpected. Landed and took some trains for a while. Got into Karasuma station around 11 and were able to check into our apartment early...which meant we napped for a while. At 1 we headed to Hale, a vegetarian restaurant in Nishiki Market, for a yuba mushroom don set with many wonderful sides of tofu and veggies and a fermented fruit spritzer. Headed to Sou Sou and picked up a nice black and white tenugi. Walked by a shop with nice leg designs and bought matching shirts. Headed to Fushimi station and went to Vermilion for an Orangina and espresso drink. Into a moderately busy Fushimi Inari. Liz wanted to do the whole hike, on which we found some charming shrines, a few friendly nekos, a sulfur cured egg, and superlative kitsune figures. Took the train to Face House, which is a house that looks like a face. Walked to Sake Bar Yoramu, which is a small bar that serves exclusively rare and unconventional sakes. The owner was very knowledgeable and helped is to appreciate some very interesting sakes, one of which had been aged in the bottle for twenty-two years and tasted to me like a moldy french cheese. Walked home and slept for a long time.<br><br>Had a lazy morning with conbini coffee and a flan crepe. Walked to Weekenders Coffee where we had a dark roast and a light roast cold brew. Both were excellent. Took a bus to Aonigiri, which it turns out was closed. Found a local beef curry restaurant where we had a beef curry and a beef hash omurice. Began our many hours long stroll down the Path of Philosophy. We mostly skipped the bigger temples and focused on small finds, like a pretty black dragonfly, tako ni neko washi tape, cats, hydrangeas, and a mouse shrine. Back in the city we found a good and cheap antique shop where we picked up a flower vase. Onto Yasaka and then the Geisha district, which was pretty dead. Tried going for Mexican food, but it was closed so we went back to the apartment for a bit to relax. Had way too many gyoza at Chao Chao. Tried to go to a gin bar, bit it was closed. Headed to steam punky L'Escamoteur for a Death in Provence: Absinthe, lavender, lemon, sugar and a Rossi Gin Fizz: Tanqueray, absinthe, vanilla, cream, egg, citrus, sugar. Left there and had a bit of difficulty finding F.S.N., a bar run by a French guy who played old Metallica. A man at the bar complimented Liz on her 'deep voice'. The owner was sweet and chatted with us for a bit on the patio.<br><br>My tattoo peeled and we headed to Kiyomizudera. Got off the bus and saw a sign for a raclette & coffee shop, so naturally we did that. We had a smoked chicken baguette and fries, each with cheese, and two lattes. Walked up to the temple and explored there a bit. Took a bus to the north east side of town where we checked out a Daruma temple Liz had found when searching for Daruma temples. It was cool and we bought a Daruma. Got our bags and headed to the airport.",r,It’s Always Sunny In,"34.967170, 135.773265","Jun 8, 2019","Jun 10, 2019",,Kyoto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://photos.app.goo.gl/QpAgbt24Jwdm6g39A
Part 4,228,x,"Remembered Liz's birthday and gave her pack of film in a wrapper with a cute drawing on it. Got on the ferry and got the premium cabin again. Read some book and ate some food. Got off a few hours later in Wellington and hit the road. Grabbed a Macca after a few more hours and got to Whakatane at around 10. Chatted a bit and to bed.  <br><br>Juanita was having some car trouble and we soon realized that we would have to take the van, whose name she informed us was Wakka Two Lips (not Tulip) up to Auckland. First we snacked on a yummy pork roast she had made and some pickles. Hit the road and made it up to Auckland in a few hours. Hung in the hotel for just a bit and then headed to Woodpecker, a Texas BBQ Asian grill. We had some delicious food including beer batter fries, frickles, tiger prawn dumplings, tempura eggplant, fermented chicken, and Korean-ish pork ribs.  <br><br>Juanita said goodbye. We checked out and walked to Best Ugly Bagels. They were playing Jailbreak when we walked in and a charming man who reminded me of Miguel was shouting along. Had a Humdinger with hummus, tomato, and zaatar. We also had another Boss Hog and two maple iced coffees. It was all so good we then decided to get a King Kong, which featured a tasty caramelized banana whipped shmear and a chewy chocolate bagel. Walked to the hotel. Liz napped a bit and I drew what could be perceived as a figure masturbating to white noise...it was the first time I'd drawn in a while. Watched Dead to Me and drank a bottle of red wine. Took and Uber to mini golf to find it closed. Went instead to a different mini golf, which was right next to the hotel. The theme was military, kiwi (the bird) and dinosaurs. We both played well, but I won by one point. Walked next to Amano for dinner. Stracciatella with fig, shallot, and honeycomb. Crayfish pulsante with garlic, lemon, and dill. Pappardelle with lamb ragu, olive, pangritata. Fell asleep with the lights on.  <br><br>Had a nice buffet and Liz headed to work. I hung for a bit and then treated myself to a massage for being a good driver. Found a good looking place nearby and did that. Had a nice woman work my back real good. Picked up another kombucha, which made my grand total for the trip at least a score. Went downtown and stopped by AS, a nice basics store where I bought things only in black. Bought some tickets for that night for two shows as part of the NZ Comedy Fest. Headed up to the room and proceeded to eat coconut Whittaker's and watch BlackkKlansman. Headed to BurgerFuel, which Juanita had recommended, for an American Muscle and a vegan burger. They were quite delicious. Went to Q Theatre next to see James Acaster, who is one of the best comedians I have seen in a while and had a great set. After that we headed directly to the next show (next door) for a trio of Australian comics. Michelle Braiser mixed vocal loops and had a heartfelt piece about wanting to fuck Aladdin. Demi Lardner had dogs for shoes and ate soap. Aaron Chen didn't do any of that funny business, but had plenty of his own.  <br><br>Kissed my lady, went to the airport, and got another bagel.",r,Road Trip NZ,"-37.953380, 176.996689","Apr 19, 2019","May 8, 2019",Juanita,"Picton, Whakatane, Auckland",4,"-41.293945, 174.775733","-37.953380, 176.996689","-36.849648, 174.763762",,,,,,,,,,,https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ve2UXhA1Qn9YjgyF7
Part 3,227,x,"We had planned to get up early and hike around Mt. Cook, but the morning was rainy and gray. We opted instead to head to High Country Salmon, a local salmon fishery, for an Eggs Benedict and a bagel, both with salmon. They were quite good. The weather was cloudy and rainy, but we decided to try our luck with Mount Cook anyway. Headed up past the sparkling blue lake and up into the valley. We hung in the car for a while and watched some Twin Peaks. No change in the weather, but we decided to do the hour return hike anyway. It was beautiful and well worth the wet toes. Started to drive back down the mountain and, as we later found out, had our multi-rib belt snap on us. Spent the next few hours figuring out what was wrong. Had some wine and food on the side of the road and slept there for the night.  <br><br>Made some 'Tow?' signs for the car, but didn't get any takers. Called Gary, the electrician and mechanic who came and picked up the van. He dropped us off at the backpackers hostel in Twizel and we hung in the lounge for a while to charge up and finish Twin Peaks. Chris, another charming local man, checked us into our room. We did some laundry, showered up, and relaxed for a while. Eventually we headed out to Ministry of Works for dinner. We had a very good burger, and a pizza with chicken, cream cheese, rosemary, apricot, and cashew. I had a nice local pale ale while Liz had first an apple crumble cider and then an apple rhubarb cider, both of which were quite good.  <br><br>Checked out. Chris offered to drive us up to High Country Salmon where we started with coffee and a caramel bar and then had salmon nachos and a salmon Thai curry. It was very crowded with tour groups. Walked back to town and found some very good looking mushrooms along the way. Stopped into poppies cafe to warm up a bit and have another coffee. Stayed by the fire quite a while and had a honey banana smoothie. Found out we wouldn't be getting the car today so we booked another night at the hostel and relaxed a bit. Wrote some postcards and picked up groceries. Dinner was yogurt roasted cauliflower with pesto pasta. We were too tired to watch a movie.  <br><br>The car was ready around 10:30. We got on the road then and headed through the very beautiful Lindus Pass, which featured golden rolling hills backed by craggy snow-topped mountains. Headed next to lakes Hawea and Wanaka. The glacial color was not as pronounced as it was in the Twizel area lakes, but there were some hints of emerald and jade. Made it to the Cardrona hotel next where we had popcorn squid, frickles, lamb skewers, and garlic bread. Caught sunset hitting a large mountain just as we came into view of the Wakatipu Basin with Queenstown at the far end of it. Had a quick stop in the revamped mining town, Arrowtown, just as the light was fading. Pulled into our camper spot in Queenstown just after dark. Did some grocery shopping and decided to snack and watch Picnic at Hanging Rock rather than venture into town for fish & chips.  <br><br>Woke up at 6:00 and walked into town to catch our coach for our Doubtful Sound tour. Drove down Lake Wakatipu and through a very lovely glacial valley. Got off at Manapouri where we took our first boat from one end of the lake to the other. Took another coach through the steep and winding mountains to get to the tip of Doubtful Sound, where we caught our second boat. Cruised through the sound and learned much about the local history, flora, and fauna. Where the sound met the Tazman sea we stopped and said hello to the seal colony. Went back in for a bit and then turned off the engines. The captain made a vague 'no promises' about seeing something special. About a minute later we saw a stirring in the water about 200m away. We began to see fins and before long we had about fifteen bottle nose dolphin friends playing around and under the ship. They showed us their tummies. Finished the boats and did the transportation in reverse. Back in Queenstown we headed to Blue Kanu and had a local IPA and essentially a strawberry pina colada to drink. For food we had pork ribs, black pepper venison, and kung pao duck nachos. Then a ginger colada. Bed bed.  <br><br>Nice wake up times. Bought some cold brew concentrate and milk and finished off the delicious cereal. Cleaned up. Walked around the downtown a bit. Liz bought a nice jade necklace for her mum. We took the gondola up the mountain and did a couple of luge rides. Hiked up the Ben Lomond trail for a bit and found some incredible mushrooms. Headed to Erik's Fish & Chips for that. Next off to Fergburger for one of those. Drove for quite a few hours, listened to some great music like Houses of the Holy, Madness, and Les Paul & Mary Ford. Camped out in the same spot outside of Christchurch that we had done about a week prior.  <br><br>Sat in the sun and read. It was lovely. A chatty forest ranger and I shot the breeze a while. Back to C1espresso for another lamb empanada, more coconut milk coffees, a cheesy pastry, and a savory muffin with butter. Hit the road and drove a while. Stopped in Kaikoura upon the recommendation of a woman in Queenstown. It was pretty and the beach was very stony. Wandered there a bit, found some very smooth stones, and got back on the road. Got to our campsite just outside of Picton and nabbed the last of twelve spots. Watched The Seventh Victim, an almost shockingly bad and boring film about a satanic cult with supposed homoerotic overtones.",l,Road Trip NZ,"-45.025900, 168.660436","Apr 19, 2019","May 8, 2019",,"Mt.

Part 2,226,x,"Awoke early. Back to Best Ugly where we had a tuna melt and a chicken sandwich; both were stellar. Next we headed to the ferry terminal and took the three-hour ride to Picton, on the south island. Other than the jerk man who lied to me about his 'friends' coming so as to not have to share his seats with us, it was pretty uneventful. Landed and were immediately in awe of how beautiful everything was. It wasn't too dissimilar from the north island, but the mountains were taller and the colors were more autumnal. Started heading south first trough some mountain passes, which had the softest fog lying gently upon them, and then down the coast. After a while we pulled over to check out the beach and snack a bit. We continued our five-hour drive south. It was pretty much non-stop gorgeous. We saw many seals playing on the rocks and in the water as we drove. Liz wanted to stay in a hotel so we did that in Christchurch. Got to our room, did some sink laundry, showered, and headed to dinner at Little High, a hip food stall hall. We had some nice local beers, a vegan burger with coconut bacon, very good chips with aioli/bbq sauce, and a pizza with cauliflower cheese sauce and fried capers. Back and to bed.  <br><br>Headed to C1espresso for nice coffee and a lamb empanada. Played some Monster Bash pinball afterward where Liz got a score of 51 million. Drove towards Akaroa and we stunned again by the continuous and ever developing beauty. We stopped by the side of a lake and had some snacks. A big duck greeted us and basically squacked at us until (and past) when we fed it after we were finished eating. A few times it walked on to our towel and we had to shoo it away. Drove up some lovely mountains and Skyped with Liz's parents near the summit. Down the other side and into Akaroa. Parked by French Bay and Skyped with Mom and Jim. Explored the cute, very French influenced, town for a bit. Began driving up a very steep and very beautiful mountain toward the outer coast, but soon there was signage warning against camper vans from taking that route. We stayed at the top of the hill, which overlooked Akaroa, and caught an incredible sunset. Drove back to Christchurch and went back to Little High for dinner. We had a roasted broccoli from Bacon Brothers plus a spicy pepperoni pizza and a huge poutine from the pizza place. Everything was delicious. Drove to a campground just outside of the city and called it a night.  <br><br>Began driving towards Mt Sunday, a.k.a. Edoras. All went well until about 20km from the site we came upon a very bumpy gravel road. We decided to continue through it, but I was a bit worried about the van falling apart. The entire area was basically Rohan, with rolling golden hills near to us and craggy snowy peaks in the distance. Made it to the parking lot for the hike, which was almost 2km each way. We we're in awe at the beauty throughout the hike. The water we had to walk through at a few points looked as though it has just melted off of a glacier. We hiked the quaint mountain; I was surprised at how small the summit was. You could hardly fit a single hall at the top let alone a whole town. It was windy and certainly looked like it belonged in a film. I left my sunglasses at the top. On accident. Began the longish drive to Late Taroko. We pulled up to the lake just after the sun dipped below the mountains, but we had about a half an hour to walk around and appreciate the views of the lake and mountains. From there we headed to the campground near the bottom of lake Pukaki. We parked the van, got out, looked up to the sky and we were both immediately in awe at how clear the stars were. The Milky Way was clearly visible and the entire sky was full of twinkling dots. We took some silly long exposure shots. Then we had some red wine with bread, cheese, and pate.

Part 1,225,x,"Massage chair after landing took my money and didn't work, which resulted in the opposite of a massage. Found someone to pay me back and got it done right. Bus to Manukau where we ate Indian food in a mall. Finished the ride to Rotorua and picked up the van. Dusted off the spider webs and did some practice driving around the neighborhood a bit. It went well so we headed to Warehouse and Countdown to stock up on supplies. Then we got gas, tidied up a bit and headed to dinner. Liz found Atticus Finch, where we ate roasted cauliflower with Dahl, coconut yogurt, & coriander; roasted greens, cashew cream, preserved lemon, quinoa & cumin crisps; lamb rump, veggies, tapenade, & feta creme. Parked on the street neat Lake Rotorua and settled in for the night. It was a bit chilly, but we slept well.  <br><br>Got up and went to Epicurian downtown for some coffee. Bought a sourdough baguette and some incredible cheese from a passionate Italian man from the farmers market. Drove around the lake and found a nice grassy spot for a picnic. Liz napped a bit and I read. Got to Waitomo and did the Glowworm Cave tour. It was only about an hour long, but the cave was wondrous and the worms, which are actually fungus gnat larvae, were very mesmerizing. Checked into to our camping spot for the night and relaxed a bit. Headed back to the caves for the Ruakuri Cave tour. There were only four of us plus the guide, Demi, who was very cool and informative. She was happy to let me take all the long exposure shots my heart desired; well, a reasonable amount anyway. We wandered through an expansive and stunning cave system for about two hours. We found more worms, pupa, and a fly. We met tubers. We saw some stunning limestone formations. Demi mentioned a nearby bushwalk that was great at night so after the tour finished we checked that out. Saw more glowworms, a loud waterfall, and some scary spiders. Came back to the hostel and made a dinner of beans & fried egg on toast, ramen noodles with Piri Piri tuna, the rest of our farmers market cheese, and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Showered and worked on computers for a bit before heading to bed. The temperature was perfect and the drizzle of the rain made for a lovely sleep.  <br><br>Had some muesli with milk and hit the road. It was a day of much driving and a good bit of rain too. Had a Macca lunch and, eight hours or so after beginning our drive, we pulled into Wellington. Went downtown and ate dinner at Chow, a mostly vegetarian, pan-Asian restaurant, where we had some nice, though unremarkable, small plates. Headed to a marina parking lot/camp site and settled in. Watched some twin peaks.  <br><br>Headed back downtown and got Best Ugly Bagels. Maple syrup iced coffee, poppy with cheese, and bacon, cheddar, egg, rocket sauce on sesame. Walked to Leeds Street Bakery to pick up some sourdough and have a salted caramel cookie. It was rainy out so we headed into Milk Crate and had an iced coffee. Got a parking ticket. Back to Milk Crate and had a hot ginger drink. Wandered the downtown area some more and killed time looking in a bookshop and a record store. We were planning on going to get tacos for lunch, but when we arrived we were not feeling enticed. We were, however, feeling quite enticed by the Malaysian pace right next door. We ordered some satay, a veggie curry, and the most incredible roti bread I've ever tasted. It was lightly salty and also sweet. It was hot and chewy, while being just a bit crispy too. Headed to Miramar peninsula for the Weta tour, which included a miniatures tour for the new Thunderbirds Are Go television show and also the Weta Cave tour, which gave a glimpse into the variety of work that Weta does. It was quite cool, though less LOTR focused than I was hoping for. We drove along the coast through the evening fog until we reached the airport. We did not have a flight, but we were hoping to see the Gollum statue in the terminal. Inside we learned that they had taken it down, but we did see Smaug's head and Gandalf riding on Gwaihir. Next we stopped at a grocery store to pick up hummus, cheese, and salami for dinner. We first parked in the same camper lot as the prior night, but I became nervous about getting a fine—we were not technically eligible to stay in that lot. As we left we saw a park ranger who I am pretty sure was checking vehicles. We tried parking along the side of the road, but it turned out to be quite a busy road and was a bit scary.

Old Crawford Punch: Jamaican rum, Cuban rum, mango, house chai, Curry leaves, clarified milk. Midnight Zombie: Caribbean rum, Genever, Calvados, passion fruit, cinnamon, lemon, dry sherry, absinthe. Headed back to the hotel and met Manav and Kartik for happy hour. Tried to find the fish stew alley, but apparently it was closed on Mondays. We did find a nice street stall where we had some rice cakes, veggie gyoza, and a chicken/onion skewer. Walked some more and came upon a fried chicken alley. Picked a place and had fried dried fish, a seafood pancake, good fried chicken and beer. The boys called it a night and we went to Marque D'Amour. The space was well designed and featured many peacock busts that blended into the ceiling decor. First we had a sweet welcome drink. Then a Soft Rain: Cocchi Americano, sherry, lime, patchouli. Dark Flowers: Diplomatico, sherry, fernet, melon. Both were quite good. From chatting to our bartender we learned he was very good at flare bartending, but that he wasn't allowed to do it here. We asked him what types of flare drinks were common he made us something called a peach crush. As we were paying, he also made us all shots of whiskey sours. Lastly, they gave us two tickets to a Picasso exhibit at a local museum. Being nice to people has its perks.<br><br>Had breakfast with Liz and then she went to work. I had trouble getting my computer online. I headed out to the market again and found the fish stew alley. After an involved process of picking all of the tiny bones out I was able to enjoy the lovely and spicy dish. Took a bus to the museum. The Cubism exhibit was pretty cool, though not very large—I was through the whole thing in a little over 20 min. Took a while getting back to the hotel, but made it in time for lounge happy hour drinks and dinner. Met Liz and her colleagues out at a chicken and beer place for Tom's going away do. It was a lot of fun and lifted my spirits after a day of some waiting and frustration. <br><br>Got up early and flew home.",l,Second,"37.526207, 127.041115","Mar 9, 2019","Mar 13, 2019",,Seoul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Takaragawa,223,x,"For a Valentine's getaway we thought we'd treat ourselves to a weekend in the onsen resort of Takaragawa. On Saturday, we awoke early, had a bit of trouble getting our JR Passes, and barely caught our train to Gunma. Made it there and then caught the ryokan shuttle bus for a winding, 45-minute drive through the mountains to the resort. Checked in and hung in our lovely room. Napped for a bit and then headed to the indoor onsen to wash. After that we walked the outdoor path to the main onsens, which were outside. There was snow all over the ground and it was actively snowing. After a couple of minutes we arrived at the onsen area, which consisted of three large pools all sat along the river. We went into the first pool. For as cold as it was outisde (about -3C), once we were in the toasty spring water we felt amazing. The pool could have easily held over 200 people, but probably only had about 20 at the moment. The outdoor pools were mixed gender. The women were all given 'bathing dresses' while the men feigned modesty by holding small towels over their appendages when they got up to walk. It began snowing more heavily, but we stayed in for quite a while to take in the view. Eventually, we heade back to the room and watched some Charlie Chaplin videos. I gave Liz some very nice chocolate I had bought the previous day in Tokyo. At 6pm we went to the ryokan restaurant for our kaiseki dinner where we were served pickles, sashimi, shrimp, tofu, salted river fish, tori nabe, broccoli & mushroom cream soup, umeboshi with apricot, and fresh fruit with whipped cream. Though it was still quite early, we were both so wiped after dinner that we went straight to bed. <br><br>Awoke and had a decent buffet breakfast. Spent the day combining snacking on chocolate and red wine, touching, watching Twin Peaks, eating ice cream, and hanging in the onsen (both indoor and outdoor). At 6pm we again went to the kaiseki restaurant for a similar meal, with slight variations in meats and preparations. This time we had mackrel, a beef nabe, and salmon sashimi. All were incredible. Finished twin peaks and slept for a bit. At around 9:30 we headed back out to the onsen (they are 24hr) for a dip in the dark. It was wonderful and we stayed out there for about an hour. <br><br>Breakfast again and checked out early to catch the bus back into town. A woman sitting behind Liz on the bus became sick and, fortunately, had a bag handy. When we got off Liz also got sick. Though it was cold and we were tired we still decided to head to Takasaki as it was on the way back and free as part of our JR pass. We did so to visit Shōrinzan Daruma-ji Temple, which is home to Daruama dolls. We visited the temple and saw many, many darumas. We bought ourselves a mid-sized white one, which makes our current collection three. From there we headed home where I made a nice dinner of fermented tomato water shrimp with a dessert of fermented banana, marscapone, and manuka honey filo wraps.

As we were walking to the castle a nice woman started chatting with us and invited us to a prayer ceremony. We politely declined and proceeded to check out the castle. Headed back to the station where we picked up some pork & shrimp dumplings and a few maki. Took a switch-backing train the rest of the way into town. Headed straight to the Hakone Open Air Museum, which we explored for a few hours. We love many of the pieces, the layout of the park, and especially the Picasso museum! Took the train one more stop to Gora and checked into the lovely Hakone Tent, which is a charming hostel/hotel. Took a dip in the private cedar onsen which felt very nice and was quite hot. Had a fruit tea in the kitchen then started walking to the brewery. On the way we saw a meowing cat in front of a conbini. We bought a can of cat food to give it, but right as we opened the can a cat grandma walked by and said hi to the cat; they proceeded to walk off together. We continued walking with the open can of food and after a minute came upon another meowing cat who seemed to appreciate the unexpected dinner. Got to the posh restaurant/brewery, had some beers with grilled shishito, crispy rice, and aburi salmon. Came back to the hotel. Had some hot sake and a great miso cream pizza. To nice Japanese women sat at our table and we chatted for a bit. Back to the room for some nice times and sleep.<br><br>Hit the onsen again, had a nice breakfast where we chatted with a French woman, and had more nice times again. Took the cable car up the mountain and then the ropeway back down. Took some very nice pictures of Fuji and got on the boat. Read some Princess Bride and got off at Motohakone. Waited a while for some yummy pastries and walked along the water. Took a bus to Hakone Yumoto. Wandered around there and bough some local citrus chu-hais. Back in Odawara, we were immediately approached by three women who seemed very interested in what we were about to do. When we said we were just heading to the grocery store, they immediately lost interest. That, couple with our prior experience with the overly kind woman led us to search online and discover that Odawara is home to a particularly aggressive sect of Buddhism. We avoided them and bought some nice veggies and a steak to take home.

Got a Grab to the Four Points and got early check in because of Liz's platinum status. Slept, made a French press, and hung a bit.

On the way we passed a building where about 30 rats had made a playground in-between a wall and decorative grate which gave the viewer a similar effect as looking at an ant farm, but for rats. The wall was a well-lighted facade feature of a posh building, which made the event especially entertaining for Liz and I. A security guard came by to see why the two of us were so enthralled with this wall and also found the need to document the experience.<br><br>Chatted with Mom for a bit and had a big buffet breakfast. Checked out at 2pm and headed to the National Museum of Singapore for a Polaroid exhibit and a quick walk through the history museum.

Taipei,220,x,"Made it to Taipei uneventfully and headed for lunch at Din Tai Fung. We had two types of soup dumplings, a BBQ pork dish, and red tea that we're all quite good. Checked into our apartment and hung for a good while. Eventually we headed out for dinner and drinks at R&D Cocktail Lab where we ate sweet potato fries dipped in truffle cheese sauce and savory fried chicken. For drinks we had Search for Pleasure (cynar, punt y mes, lemon, orange bitters); a Hibiscus Fizz, a Hot Buttered Rum, and a hojicha Old Fashioned.<br><br>I grabbed coffee, red dragon fruit, and some pastries from the market before we hopped on the bus towards Jiufen. Got there. Wandered through adorable, crowded streets. Almost had a pot of tea, but for >$20, we thought better of it. Snacked on grilled eringi, Taiwanese sausage, tofu, and ice cream mochi. Back to town and to Yongkang Beef Noodles for the eponymous dish, which was nice and underwhelming. We were about to call it an early night, but we happened to be near Alchemy, so we went in for a drink. Milk Punch: cognac, dark rum, milk, vanilla, Angostura. Heart of Aztec: tequila, pineapple, cacao, honey, lime juice, brulee lavender buds.<br><br>Up early for a bus and train ride to Hualien. Tried our luck at finding a scooter rental place that would rent to us (most only rent to locals) and got one on our third try. It was perfect weather. We drove through town, then along a highway - with it's own scooter lane - and into Taroko Gorge. We spent a few hours cruising up into the mountains, checking out temples, and taking in the unreal sizes, shapes, and colors. Made it back into town right before sunset and caught a train back to Taipei. Liz had to work a bit so we hung at a Starbucks and then at a Mos Burger, where we had a rice bun wagyu burger. Hit the Raohe night market near Songshan and then got a ride to Ounce. Sensation: gin, marashino, lime, mint. 1864: mezcal, vermouth, aperol, campari, mole bitters, orange.<br><br>I picked up a persimmon and some delicious cherry tomatoes for breakfast.

We eventually headed down to Yongkang Street again and went to Jin Ji Yuan. We had a yummy pork roll, which was reminiscent of an English sausage roll. Then we had pork soup dumplings and another kind which had a shrimp on top. It was all incredible and quite cheap. We walked south and wandered around Shida night market before heading up to Smoothie House for a sugar overload in the form of a mountain of shaved ice topped with raspberry, strawberry, mango, and strawberry ice cream. It also came with a side of custard. We opted for a quiet night in and a movie, though we ended up just falling asleep.<br><br>Another lazy morning of coffee and tomatoes.

Let's see if I can manage both. <br><br>To Rueifong night market for dumplings, brown sugar boba milk, shrimp yaki, an addicting ring bottle game, watermelon milk, and a salted pork bun.<br><br>Lazy morning with French tarts and cold brew. Taro chunks in green tea. Temples on the lake. Into a dragon's mouth, out of a tiger's. Chalupa-like bread, egg, cabbage, and sweet chili sauce. More temples. Sweet, spicy, sticky roasted corn. Uber to Pier 2. Pretty sculptures and cosplay people were abound. Pet some cats and had Gong Cha boba (brown sugar pearl latte). To the food market for incredible garlic lobster, dark sauce and onion scallops, and salted grilled shrimp. Bought some massage tools. Back at the hotel we ate Pringles, drank beer, and gave massages.<br><br>Had some weird breakfast in the hotel. A woman was playing a bluesy, repetitive version of Fly Me to the Moon. Took a train to Tainan, had a boba sugar milk, and checked into our tree house hotel. Hung there a while and then headed out to explore the town. Found a place that specialized in a rice porridge with pork and shiitake. There we also had a nice dumpling soup and pork with sauteed greens. Wandered some very charming streets and found many cats, great architecture, ornate temples, and interesting street art. Headed towards Shennong Street when we passed a cafe that had many cats inside. We went in, played with some cats, had a huge rose milk tea and a creamy boba toast. They also treated us to an incredible crème brûlée cheesecake. Down Shennong where I bought a nice vegan leather wallet then headed back to the hotel for a bit. Headed to The Checkered Record Club. There was a wait so we headed to a small food stalls serving incredible danzai (noodles in broth with ground pork, shrimp, and a brown egg). Back to TCRC for a tequila, orange juice, and elderflower drink for Liz and a mezcal, umeshu, pineapple, and black pepper drink for me. Back to the hotel where Liz had a long night of work. <br><br>Liz had a work call so I wandered the city a bit in search of a danbing (tortilla egg wrap).

Nagasaki,218,x,"We were meant to fly to Kyoto, but with about sixty standby passengers ahead of us, we opted for a better bet and caught a flight to Nagasaki. We ate a delicious beef curry pan on the plane while I read of troubles in Bree. Checked into a not-too-smoky room. Slept a while. Woke up and walked to Inasayama where we took a ropeway to the top and enjoyed a magical sunset follow by pretty glittering lights. Walked back to town and took the trolley downtown. Had a bad Singapore Sling in a charming antiquated CD (music) bar. Wandered and found a cool looking tiny bar with an eyeball on the door, but we're turned away by the trans probable racist tender. Went to a sushi place that looked nice. A lovely man and woman at the counter translated for us that we would need to wait about twenty minutes. About six minutes later they came out and apologized for taking so long, then gave us their seats and also bought us possibly the best chutoro we've ever had. On top of that we had some incredible ika, ebi, tamago, uni, aburi saba, anago, and local sake. We enjoyed it so much Liz recommend we book reservations to come back again the next night so we did. <br><br> Headed to NGS Coffee for a delicious iced chestnut latte and a hot chestnut hojicha latte. We were a bit disappointed to find our tour boat would not land on Gunkanjima because of typhoon damage, but we did the cruise anyway (as they wouldn't give us a refund). It was pretty awesome to see. Went through Glover Garden and saw a church. We had a short rest in the hotel and then took a train to Konagaicho; a small town that has fruit shaped bus stops. Saw a few of them until it got dark and took the train back to the sushi restaurant. Had a whole bunch of lovely sushi. A weird older man came in and left before too long. A sweet Japanese couple bought us an akadashi miso soup. We chatted with them a bit and, before we parted, they invited us to join them for breakfast the next morning. <br><br> Got picked up by Satoshi and Ikuko. They drove us to the port fish market for a stellar and very reasonably priced kaisendon breakfast. They dropped us off at the Peace Park where there were many tourists. We then walked to the hypocenter park where we heard school children singing to the monolith. Next to the Atonic Bomb Museum. Had another chestnut coffee from NGS Coffee then headed downtown to wander, look for neko-ni-takos, and look at a pretty bridge. At a pork bun and some delicious soup dumplings.

Kanazawa,217,x,"Took a bus into town. Had a dark chocolate apple Frappuccino and watched children trick or treating while enrolling in health insurance. Went to a gorilla themed curry restaurant and ate with forks, which was weird. Took a crowded bus to Kenrokuen - a big beautiful garden - and looked at the lovely things for a good while. Walked over to the geisha district and chatted with some Americans on the way. Saw a very cool art deco building mixed in with the geisha houses. Headed back to the hotel and grabbed some conbini food on the way. We both fell immediately asleep. Later I checked out the onsen where I sat outside (on the roof of a 14 story building) in a very hot pool and let the rain drizzle on me. It was nice. <br><br>Watched some Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and ate melted ice cream. Went to the museum, but they wouldn't let us take bags in so we said fuck it and went to a shrine where we bought some more inari statues.

We we're uninspired by the food options so we had a Princess frappuccino and another pork & mushroom sandwich from Starbucks. And headed back to the airport.

Seoul,216,x ,"Up early and made the flight. Liz got business and had some nice food. I had egg salad on a hot dog bun and watched part of Blade Runner 2049. Landed and took an hour long can ride into the city for $20. Checked into our hotel. We were both wiped so we napped for an hour. We were still wiped so we kept sleeping a while. Got up and went to the metro station. Took the train to Hongdae. It was a cute, lively area with interesting architecture, lots of restaurants, and many people out on the street. It felt like a much larger version of Cat Street in Harajuku. In many ways, Seoul immediately felt like a more laid back version of Tokyo. That being said, we found ourselves using the work 'brusk' often when describing interactions with the locals. We went into a beauty shop and bought many face masks and also foot masks. Walked on a bit and had nice chicken skewers from a street stall. On one street watched people play a carnival style balloon dart game, some teenage kids practicing their dance moves, and people doing street karaoke. More beauty shops, brutalist architecture, and Danish mid-century furniture. Stopped into a grill restaurant for pork tripe with belly meat and a strong, smooth soju. Then we headed to Bar d.still where I had a BCG (beet, cherry, grape) that was nice, though a little flat. Liz had a Wild Style with gin, lemon, egg white, and Galliano. Took a cheap cab back. <br><br> Took our time getting up. Ate a nice buffet breakfast. Watched some End of the F***ing World. Chatted with Scott for a few. Moved to the posh Plaza hotel after watching some Mongolian singers. They upgraded us to a very nice room. Went to the club and had some snacks. Walked through some palace grounds and visited a modern & contemporary art museum. There were some nice pieces and we mostly preferred the abstract stuff. Bought some more face masks and headed south to Maple Tree House for grapefruit soju, and Korean BBQ including: miso, kimchi, pork jowl, marinated pork collar, and a nice beef striploin. Took a bus back and went to bed. <br><br> Had breakfast in the club lounge. Hung out in the hotel for a while while Liz prepped for her meeting later in the day. We met Yeo Kwang in the lobby. He was so sweet and seemed genuinely so happy to see us. We headed to a great chicken soup restaurant where we spent the next hour catching up. The food was great, though I lost my appetite slightly when an old woman sat down beind us and proceeded to make disgusting snorting and spitting sounds for the next thirty minutes. I later asked Yeo Kwang if that was a normal behavior and he said it was definitely not! We said goodbye to Liz, grabbed a coffee, and headed towards Gyeongbokgung, the ancient royal palace. We spent a while wandering the grounds, he taught me a bit about Korean hihstory, and we discussed music therapy ideas. I saw him off and began heading back to the hotel, when I notice I was right next to the Korean Contemporary History Museum. I went in and spent the next hour and a half learning about the past 150 years in this peninsula. It was pouring when I left, but I really wanted to see the comfort women statue outside the Japan Embassy so I walked over to that. There was a guard watching the statue, to presumably discourage vandalism. I bought a few tops from Uniqlo, picked up some snacks for later, and headed back to the hotel. I quickly went up to the club for happy hour where I had some nice vegetable lasagne and taught the attendants how to make a Negroni. Liz surprised me after a few and we snacked and drank some more together. We headed back and she immediately fell asleep. <br><br> I worked on my video game for a while. Then I drank a bottle of soju and looked at abstract art. I convinced a reluctant cab driver to take me to a mediocre burger restaurant. Next I took a bus back downtown to get my bag and meet my Liz.

Ishigaki,215,x,"Made a standby flight just in time to avoid the typhoon that was about to hit Tokyo. Landed and caught a bus to Ishigaki City. To the hotel and relaxed for a bit. Got up, ate a delicious burger from a stand down the street that is connected to a yakiniku restaurant, and headed to the port to catch a bus to a beach. We met a lovely, sassy woman at the info counter who informed us that it was way too late in the day to try to catch a bus to the beach and also that Ishigaki is renowned for the beef from the cattle raised there. She recommended we visit the island's oldest temple and a nearby garden, which we then did. The temple was old and the garden was serene, from the front at least. We then walked to the cute town shopping area where Liz got a pineapple popsicle and a drunk man asked me some questions. Came upon a live music and dance performance, which we watched for a few. Then we relaxed in the hotel and watched some OITNB. At one point I went to Family Mart to get a taco rice maki, Pringles, and some very delicious pineapple-shikuwasa beer.<br><br>Took our time getting up the next morning. Had some chanpuru and Blue Seal ice cream for breakfast. Checked out and caught a local bus up to Kabira Bay. Walked down to the beach. The water varied in shades from deep blue, to seafoam green, to emerald. There were a few glass-bottom boats docked along the beach which were regularly ferrying people to a nearby reef. We walked down the beach for a few minutes and found a shady spot under a steep bank. We stayed there for a few hours while we slept, read, explored the sea life, and I got sunburnt. We saw hundreds of hermit crabs, some sea cucumbers, snails, pretty blue fish, and a big starfish. Headed back up to a restaurant where we had a beef croquette, a soba dish, a beer, and then a soft serve. Wandered around the park area and then stopped by a local awamori distillery where we picked up a bottle. Caught the bus down to Fusaki Beach, which we had to walk through a resort to arrive at. The water was protected by nets and lifeguards because of the many jellyfish that live in the waters. We swam in the warm, salty undulations and lay on the beach until the sun dipped below the clouds for the evening. We then took a bus back into town, checked into our new hotel, and took showers. Walked down to Ishigaki cattle Maru, where we had some local yakiniku, hot-stone bibimbap, and sours. We had picked up some more of the pineapple-shikuwasa beers and were planning on watching more OITNB, but we were both so tired we came back and fell immediately asleep.<br><br>Woke up ten and half hours later. Had some coffee, Spam onigiri, and beers and watched an episode. Checked out and took a bus to the ANA resort hotel beach. It was quite hot and neither of us were really feeling this beach, which had many kids running around, so we caught another bus a little while later and hung at the airport instead. We ate a Spam-don and one last goya chanpuru before catching a flight back to Tokyo, where we had quite conveniently missed out on the typhoon.",r,Hot Beef Island,"24.338284, 124.157782","Jul 28, 2018","Jul 30, 2018",,Ishigaki,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We had a nice time strolling along the river. We visited the National Museum of Art and learned about a few new Japanese artists. I listened to a wonderful street performer who sounded like a one man Sigur Ros. We actually tried Pachinko. It was very difficult to understand, our machines kept beeping and giving us error messages, and people kept trying to help us even though we were helpless.

Took some nice photos and time lapse shots. The boat parked. Small boat to kayaking, swimming, and beach area. It was a very small beach that had a lot of people on it and was quite littered. They were very strict about exactly where we could kayak, which was only the route from the pickup area to the beach. Back to boat for tea, relaxing, and dinner. Many nice Vietnamese dishes. Liz completed a Vietnamese wood puzzle and we unsuccessfully tried squid fishing.<br><br>It was a rainy morning. We, as a group, decided to skip early kayaking for more time exploring the bay. Switched to the day boat. Played Vietnamese cards inside as we headed towards the floating fishing village. The village was a an area on the water protected by steep rocks on all sides. We switched to a bamboo row boat and explored the nearly deserted village. It was quiet, drizzly, and serene. Under an natural rock arch and then back to the day boat. Lunch with nice fried pork rolls. New folks on the big boat and the same kayaking beach trip as the prior day. Drank tea with a nice sunset. Ate a many course dinner. Sim (a 20-ish local woman who worked on the boat) was very charming and very committed to making karaoke happen. We finally got someone's phone to connect to the PA and I sang All Star to a few Australian families and the Vietnamese crew. It was a bit odd, but there was nothing else to do on the boat so people seemed content to keep it going. Some of the kids braved the crowd and sang a few songs I didn't know.

I drank Awamori with David in the hotel reception. Out. The taco shop was closed. But we found another Mexican place, which ended up being perfect — Borrachos. The staff had tattoos and we had margaritas, chips and salsa, shrimp quesadilla, goat tacos, taco rice, and a chicken quesadilla. Met a kind ojiisan, a well known local musician, and a news anchor. We we're tasting very hot sauce straight. I poured out too much on a plate. The musician proceed to take the plate around the restaurant and feed the very hot sauce to anyone who would accept, which was pretty much everyone. People were hilarious and had very over the top Japanese reactions. Eventually the kitchen staff came out and confiscated the hot sauce plate from him probably due to fears of the many health code violations being broken. We were all drunk.<br><br>Woke up still drunk. To the ferry that would take us to Tokashiki. Though it was a large boat the sea was rough and it rocked heavily throughout the journey. Got to the island and we rented a car. We drove by a mass suicide site. There was a plaque detailing the absolutely devastating suicides of entire families who huddled around grenades and strangled themselves with torn cloth in fear of what the American soldiers would do to them when they invaded. We cruised the island and found an observation spot. We peered through some unfocused binoculars. We then fad taco rice and a karaage bowl and saw many cats in a small town. To the beach.

Kyoto,185,x,"Waited at Haneda for much of the day not getting on flights. Finally made one and got in late. Not much was open. Found a gastro pub and had nice beers, pizza, and caramelized onions. Got to Arashiyama too late. The lady from the hostel gave me a hard time. <br><br>It was an utterly beautiful morning. Enjoyed Arashiyama for a few hours. Did a nice shrine with many colorful trees, a pond, and a garden right off the main street. Down to the water for unreal sights and colors. Eventually headed to Inari station. I didn't do that shrine, but went for a nice cortado nearby and met some lovely Australian women. Walked up to Tofukuji with loads of people and many areas to explore.

Chiang Mai,183,x,"To the hotel. They gave us floating lantern gift to palace in the river. They also drove us into the madness that was downton. So many people and so many lanterns! We bought two and set them off in the middle of the fun. Walked down to the river river and set off our floaters. Some people just a little ways down stream were collecting them. Wandered around. Mexican restaurant attempt, but it closed early. Instead we found a street food area with many carts. We had some great satay, pad see ew, and banana chocolate roti. Bed. <br><br>Nice fruit muesli. Worked a while. Back to the Mexican restaurant for cold brew, tacos, and quesadilla. To the town center. We got massages. Walked to the street night market. Bought Barb a singing bowl. Had a massive and incredible bowl of Tom Yum for a couple of bucks. The guy was about to close up for the night so he put in a bunch of extra jumbo prawns and scallops. It was the best Tom Yum of my life.<br><br>Picked up by the elephant bus for elephant day. To the elephant conservatory and saw OLIPHANTS...I mean elephants. There were six I think and they were all adorable. First we fed them buckets of sugarcane. We were able to pet them and even touch their tongues while feeding them. Took them on a walk up through the woods where they ate so many trees. We walked right alongside them and at times felt as though we may get trampled. Had a nice massaman curry lunch at the building. Walked the elephants to the river. I wasn't looking and rammed a rusty piece of barbed wire into the side of my calf. Liz got in the river and played with them. They were being silly and the smaller ones were jumping on each other.

Chiang Rai,182,x,"Cab to B&B. It was cute, but warm and Liz was not feeling well. I went to Heaven Burger and brought back some great burgers. Worked a while. Night out. Had a nice, fresh strawberry milkshake. Wandered the night market. I bought some pants. To a pool bar. The people in there were pretty weird. There was an older white guy who was 'DJing' by blasting house music videos on Youtube. Every couple of minutes he appeared to get bored with the track and would cut to a new house track. Some Thai ladies in at least their 40s would at times go up and give him a lap dance. One came up and grinded on Liz for a bit. We played another round of pool though because it and the beer were super cheap.<br><br>Ate some gross toast with margarine. To the bus station. Took a bus to white temple. It was surreal and seemed like a satire of religion, such as having a huge mural about the creation of the earth which included characters like Darth Vader and Pikachu. However, it was also an actual temple and there were local people praying inside. Had some nice pork, satay, and pad Thai. Got our bags and went back to bus station. Apparently all the busses to Chiang Mai were fully booked. We decided to find a few other tourists who had been left behind and all rented a 'taxi' together. The taxi was a pickup truck with an open camper shell on the back with bench seats 8 of us sat in. It was fun and scary and dusty. We picked up a bunch of weird snacks and drank warm beer as our driver drove like a madman to get us to the city.",r,Thailand,"19.905911, 99.831065","Nov 2, 2017","Nov 3, 2017",,"Bangkok, Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai",2,"13.723138, 100.518473","19.905911, 99.831065","18.788081, 98.987924",,,,,,,,,,,https://photos.app.goo.gl/q6A8AlnESrdWpCSj2

Nice big shrimp and satay. Sirocco rooftop bar for nice drinks and a cool view with Kate, Simon, Mark, and Michael. Blue Elephant: Tom Kha, scallops, foie gras. I had pretty bad stomach cramps, but only for about an hour.<br><br>Mall shopping. Tuk tuk drivers tried ripping me off on my way back so I rode on the back of a guy's motorcycle for much less money.

Siem Reap,180,x,"A very nice check-in guy checked us in. To a nice room. Then to Footsteps Cafe for Amok Lap Lok (an incredible fish curry), a banana smoothie, and coffee. To Hard Rock Cafe for Dad gifts. Next to Angkor Wat Putt, an Angkor Wat themed mini golf course a man built it on his property. There are miniature replicas of many of the temples. Jeff Beck and the like were playing. We had some beers. Liz got a hole-in-one on the most difficult hole. It started pouring. We met some kind gaijin teachers. Finished our game and went back to the city. To Mama Shop for great pizza and burrata. Next to the night market for some tight pants.<br><br>Hotel breakfast. The servers were oppressively over attentive. We rented bikes and rode to the Angkor Wat ticket office. We bought tickets, but it was very hot and Liz was suffering from heat exhaustion. Returned to the hotel. Slept a while. Met Dara, a tuk tuk driver who would become our go to guy from then on out. To a family restaurant for Lol Lak, spring rolls, fish soup, a banana shake, and coffee with condensed milk. Met a cute cat. To the old market for pants and a scarf. Tuk tuk back. Relaxed and bit and got massages in a hotel room. Liz slept. I went out for dinner. I found the area with the best looking food carts and picked up fried rice and grilled chicken. Brought some back to Liz and we watched Moone Boy.<br><br>Breakfast fried rice. Dara picked us up and we commenced our Angkor tour. First to Angkor Wat. Through the bridge tunnel. Saw monkeys and pigs. To Angkor Thom. Ate at a touristy restaurant with great food. We had coconut shakes, 'spicy' sour fish soup, and pineapple chicken stir fry. To Bayon, a temple with many faces and many tourists at top. Liz still wasn't feeling well so we took a break for a little bit. Next to Preah Khan which had two moats and a very cool tree growing up through a two story building. Liz was all done. Took the tuk tuk back. She threw up in a park and then felt a bit better. Hotel sleeps. I went solo to Marum for a young coconut lime shake, a red ant beef kafir stir fry, and a tea smoked chicken dish with chinese broccoli. Brought some back for her.<br><br>5am pickup from Dara. To Angkor Wat for the sunrise. It was beautiful, but overall too cloudy for much of a sunrise. Had sweet coffees and eggs with bacon & cheese at a place Dara took us to. Next to Ta Prohm (a.k.a. the 'Tomb Raider' temple). Then to Banteay Kdei where we were hit with a sudden rain. Back to the hotel. Showered and had nice ribs and a fish paste and pork 'dip' at Viroth's. Picked up again by Dara. To Kampong Phluk floating village. It was quite pricey and our 'tour' boat was driven by boy. By a pretty village. He pulled over and we were told to get off the boat. We were then told to pay more for a different boat (a rowboat through the mangroves we would soon find out). It may have been nice, but we weren't expecting any of this sudden change and were already unhappy about paying so much for the initial tickets so we said no and got back on the first boat. It was weird and we felt pretty uncomfortable. Went by the mangroves and then to a big lake. We sat there for a few min still on the water and then went back. We couldn't find Dara at first. When we did we complained a bit to him and he seemed to feel quite bad. To Bakong, our final temple. He bought us a coconut to apologize for the bad time we had. We were very grateful and had a nice time after that. We walked around the temple for a while. The imps were cute. They followed Liz around and tried to (did) scare me. They cracked up. There was lovely live music coming from the monastery next to the temple. Back in tuk to hotel.

We hiked down to the very red beach at the bottom of a tall cliff. It looked very susceptible to a sudden landslide. Had some sugary drinks in the parking lot. Next to Akrotiri lighthouse at the end of the island. Hiked around there a bit. Did a meal at a nice restaurant where, when we drove by earlier, the woman owner gave us a big genuine wave and smile. It was an absolutely charming place where we had eggplant with garlic, baked cheese with peppers, moussaka, and homemade strawberry and chocolate ice cream bars for dessert. We bought some caper leaves and sun dried tomatoes in jars from their shop. I wish we could go back there over and over. We drove up to the highest point on the island and were treated to stunning views. Below us was a misty, fantasy world. Drove next to Pyrgos, our favorite town on the island. There were no roads here, just alleys. If M.C. Escher and Gaudi designed a town, this would be it. We saw many cats. It was basically true cat castle.

Lucky's gyros again. I wanted to ride a donkey down to the port. Liz was not so fond of the idea, but acquiesced. It was frightening, exciting, and smelly. The port was nothing special so we took the cable car up. Napped. To Santo Winery where we hung for a few hours while doing a tasting of 18 smallish glasses of wine and more cheese than even we could eat. There was not much of a sunset due to the heavy haze, but we thoroughly enjoyed it all. A bunch of Americans flagged down a bus and got back to Fira.<br><br>ATV excursion day 2: the north half. Started with pastries, coffee, and a 300cc ATV. It was a much better machine. To a nice, but hot beach. Didn't stay long. Next beach.

We followed a tour group down to what we found out was a nude beach with beautiful views of cliffs.The group left and there were only a few folks around. I partook in the removing of clothes. Liz did not. The weather and water were great. I went swimming, but my mind was stuck on the though of sharks nipping off my favorite bits so I didn't stay out long. Drove to Ammoudi bay. There were octopodes hanging on a line. We ate tzatziki fries, grilled mussels in mustard sauce, and grilled squid. Back to Fira. More beer & Lucky's.<br><br>Rode a dizzying bus to Oia. We arrived to our freshly built, surreal-minimalist hotel. Went for a swim in the cool pool. Back to Ammoudi Bay again for a not-as-good-as-before meal. Walked up the cliff.

Svalbard,129,x,"Bus to hotel. There was a lot of snow. We slept a while. We got up and walked to the town. Picked up bread and tinned mackerel and liver from the grocery store.

Got onto the boat, which had a sweet dog on board. Saw many pretty mountains as we began to head through the fjords. We learned about suicide birds, who apparently after losing their mate will commit suicide by diving down into the icy water. We tried to confirm this on the internet later and are not convinced it is true. Our boat began breaking up ice sheets as we entered less-frequented waters. Ate a lunch of salmon, whale, rice, salad, bread. We cruised by a massive glacier. It was the first glacier I had ever seen and I was in awe. There was too much ice out still for us to be able to go to Pyramiden, an abandoned Russian mining town, so we stayed on the boat and continued our tour. It was very cold in the boat and it was difficult to get comfortable. We passed a cabin on the land where, almost 100 years ago, a dozen men died because they were stuck there for a winter and got lead poisoning from cooking their food in the can instead of transferring them to pots. Back to land and to the hotel. We ate cheese puffs and cuddled in bed.<br><br>Same breakfast. I gave Liz a palimpsest Bel-Air birthday card.

He took us to the old pub with a chair nailed up on the wall that he told us Roger Daltrey sat in. A guy messed up a cover of a Matchbox 20 song. To a metal pub.

Wandered the favela below the cable car. It was lovely and festive, but I felt out of place. To the touristy area of El Poblado. I had a carne fajita cone. It felt very inauthentic. I tried to find local music. I found a group, but they were busking directly to couples on the street and not just playing for pleasure. A man wearing nearly twenty stacked hats followed them and tried to sell hats. I found a rock cover band doing the Cranberries at a bar. I stayed and had Calamari — or possibly pig rectum.<br><br>Hostel breakfast. To Plaza Botero. Saw the wildest street entertainer I have ever seen. I couldn't understand any of it. He may have been out of his mind, but his stuff really felt like a serious commentary on society. He put a lit cigarette into a toy gorilla's mouth. He mad some interesting tubes out of rolled paper. Then cut some newspaper with a razor blade and demonstrated how it would not slice open his jugular or palm. He then unbuttoned his shirt to reveal a safety pin piercing his nipple. Attached to the pin was a small cloth bag containing conical diamond shaped black pebbles. These pebbles apparently had the effect of removing coloring from water. I left. In the museum, I very much enjoyed the Botero works. Went to Pergamino, had a great coffee, and watched the game with a room of about 60 people. Colombia won. Afterward the streets were a joyous party for the rest of the evening. Many people (myself included) were spraying foam all over. It was reminiscent of Holi.

With the exception of a rough start at the airport, a few stalls, not figuring out how to put it in reverse, and probably burning out the clutch, I think it went okay. To gloss over the gritty details I'll say that we were both fine, we didn't have to pay the $1,000 deposit, and I hope whoever got it next didn't have any trouble with third gear. We enjoyed driving up and down the cost and touring the island. We had a private room in the hostel. The other residents were mostly professional-aspiring surfers.

It got weird and he seemed to get annoyed that we didn't know what type of adventure we wanted to do. He informed us he would check in on us after lunch. He did manage to find us on the street shortly after lunch, but after giving him the cold shoulder we were able to shake him off.

Had too many people for one cab so we opted for a limo. The ceremony was quaint and lovely. Liz and I stopped at Gordon Ramsay's pub for a snack & drink before dinner. Then to Batista's for dinner. The food was crap, but we drank loads of wine and Devyn got drunk for maybe the first time. Liz, Justin, Danielle, Krys, Devyn, Gian and I wandered the casino for a bit. Justin saw a motorcycle as a prize above a slot machine and loudly proclaimed 'Hey, look at that motorcycle, fuck you!'. Liz and I saw Cirque du Soleil's Love at Mandalay Bay. The music and performance were both incredible. Then we literally ran over to Planet Hollywood to see a Cee-lo Green concert (to which Gian had just put our names on a list for). It was wild and pretty hokey, but incredible. At one point Boy George came out and did a lip-sync to a medley of his hits.

Bought a pork pie hat from Goorin Bros. To the theatre for the concert. The opening act was a nice (not ska) two piece. Then The Specials performed. It was my first time seeing Terry Hall and I was perplexed by his stage presence. He didn't smile once and only from time to time would give any indication (such as a curtsy) that he was enjoying himself whatsoever. It was a blast. We met Andy after the show.

To the beach and played frisbee, a dog joined in for a bit. Continuing to a cave and went inside. To the end of the road. Sat on a beach and watched the sunset.

New York,17,x,"The flight was weird. A mother with a baby was angry about changing seats even after the crew explained that in an emergency there wouldn't have been an oxygen mask for the baby. To NY. I bought a beanie and gloves. Train to downtown. There was a long line for the bathroom in Starbucks and some folks were pretty angry. Got put in a large pen full of people near 57th street. We could barely see The Ball as it was about ten blocks away. We stood around for 3.5 hours. It was crowded, but quite dark. We used the opportunity to take turns making each other feel nice. Later we met a lovely Colombian family. The had brought dried lentils, which are a good luck charm for the new year, and shared them with us. We put some in our pockets and threw some up in the air when the clock struck 12. The crowd had been extremely mellow for the entire wait (it's not very much fun waiting in a pen), then there was a period of maybe two minutes of excited celebration. Then the crowd nearly completely dispersed. A few minutes after midnight we were able to walk around a deserted Times Square. A horn band was playing Auld Lang Syne on the street (probably on loop the whole night). To a pub for a drink. Then headed back to the airport.

Las Vegas,15,x,"I knew I would propose on this day. I brought the necklace and the photostrip featuring me holding cards asking 'Will-you-marry-me?'. I made sure to have sock problems throughout the day to desensitize Liz to my getting down on one knee. I hadn't, however, decided where or when I would propose. We arrived and went to the Bellagio Buffet to eat, though we then decided against it and had crepes instead. We walked around the Bellagio and I visualized every spot as a potential location. I wanted to wait until it felt right...It didn't take long. When we were leaving the building the sun had just set, the fountains were on, and Elton John was playing through the speakers. We were walking down along the fountain. I stopped and asked Liz to hold my coat while I 'adjusted my socks'. I then asked her to get my phone out of my jacket pocket, where I had placed the photostrip. She patted the pocket and said it wasn't in there. I said it definitely was and asked her to check again. Then she pulled out the strip, read it, and looked at me. I was on one knee holding the necklace open and asked her if she would marry me. She jumped down to my level, wrapped her arms around me, and started kissing me. After a minute she stopped kissing me, looked me in the eyes, and said 'YES!'.<br><br>We kissed some more and then continued walking as we had reservations for the Penn & Teller show. On the way she called her parents — who already knew of course — and informed a few of her friends. The show was fantastic. Liz even participated in the show by reading a joke from a joke book to the audience, which was tied to one of their magic tricks. Liz found Puppy's mouse, which he snuck in her bag.

Vancouver,12,x,"Our first mission was to eat some poutine. We did. Then we crossed the bridge to Granville Market where we looked through kaleidoscopes and ate olives and purple peppers. Took the bus to our hotel. It dropped us off near the hotel in Vancouver's equivalent of Skid Row. We were surrounded by homeless people. It was a very strange sensation. Though no one interacted with us, being dropped off in the middle of a derelict street put us in a bit of a state of shock. While nothing was said between us, we had each silently decided we would cancel the hotel. However, when we crossed the last block to the hotel we found that mood suddenly changed. It was as though the large homeless community consciously decided that their area ended there. In the end we kept our booking, thoroughly enjoyed the hotel, and didn't have any issues with the next door community. Walked downtown where we watched a very talented roller skater/dancer.<br><br>We got up and headed to Stanley Park where we rented a tandem bike. It was a bit tricky to ride at first, but we got the hang of it after a while. Finished that and then found some cheap sushi. To the gay district for more poutine. It was cold out so we went to the movie theatre and watched Looper. The tickets were expensive so after Looper we snuck in to see The Master. Headed to Greyhound terminal early (though late at night), but it was closed. We tried to sleep on the street, but it was too cold so we went into a McDonalds. They let us hang out there, but they wouldn't let us sleep so we forced ourselves to stay awake.
